# WelcoMate Trip Planner

## Project Description

**WelcoMate Trip Planner** is a SaaS product designed to enhance guest experiences for middle to large-scale hotels, resorts, and, in the future, corporations and educational institutions (B2B). WelcoMate offers dynamic, personalized trip planning based on real-time weather conditions and user preferences, providing guests with a tailored experience to make the most of their stay.

### Key Features:
1. **Weather-based Recommendations**: WelcoMate fetches weather data using a weather API to specify appropriate attractions for users to visit on each particular day.
2. **Attractions and Restaurants**: The system recommends local attractions and restaurants by leveraging HuggingFaceâ€™s sentence transformer (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) to calculate semantic similarities between user inputs and available descriptions.
3. **Dynamic Trip Planning**: After fetching and analyzing relevant data, WelcoMate sends it to the Gemini API, which generates a personalized trip plan tailored to the user's preferences.
