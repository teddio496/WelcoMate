## üõ† Installation & Setup 

### Step 1: Set up environment variables

- First, open your terminal and run the command `cd web-app`.
- Then, in the `/web-app` directory, create a `.env` file and add the following environment variables:

```env
HUGGINGFACE_KEY='YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY'
GEMINI_KEY='YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY'
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET='Any string here would do'
REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET='Any string here would do'
```

### Step 2: Install dependencies and deploy

- Intall dependencies using `npm i`.
- Run the development server using `npm run dev`.Ô∏è 

### Step 3: Login as a hotel guest

- No hotel guest is currently logged in, so we have provided an admin account for your supposed hotel.  
- Visit `localhost:3000/adminLogin` and login with username `davinci` and password `thebesthackathon`.  
- Here you will see an example customer pre-registered for your hotel. Click on `Create Login` to send them an email with a link to create their account.  
- Since you cannot access this email account, a link to login to that customers' account will show up on the page. Copy and paste it into a new tab. 
- Now you are a hotel guest who has just logged into Welcomate! Enjoy the app and its features!
