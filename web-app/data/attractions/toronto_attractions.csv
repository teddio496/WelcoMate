1,Toronto Island Ferries & Ward's Island Ferry Docks,Ward's Island Ferry Docks,"Ferries have been traversing the short route across Toronto Harbour from the mainland to Toronto Island Park for almost 180 years, with the first vessel - a boat powered by two horses walking on a treadmill - entering commercial service in 1833. At this time, Toronto Island was actually a peninsula connected to the mainland near the mouth of the Don River. A violent storm in April 1858 permanently severed the island from the mainland, creating the now 300-metre wide Eastern Gap. Most of the ferries still operating to the island today are diesel boats constructed between 1935 and 1960. One vessel, the Trillium, is over 100 years old, and is the only sidewheel paddle steamer still sailing in North America! While ferry services operate to 2 other different points on the island for much of the year (Centre Island and Hanlan's Point), Ward's Island is the only dock that offers year-round service.

2,Ward's Island Homes,Area to the north and east of Ward's Island Ferry Docks,"Ward's Island was named after David Ward, a local fisherman who settled near here around 1830. Ward's son William built a hotel in 1882, which spurred development on the land around it. Many of the plots here originally featured small, crowded tents that island-goers set up in the summer months. The City granted permission to replace these tents with houses in the 1930s, which explains the relatively small lot sizes of the homes today. In the 1960s, local government decided Toronto Island should be turned entirely into parkland, and the homes here were threatened with demolition. A lengthy legal battle ensued, which was ultimately won by Ward's Island residents, with their property rights preserved under a special piece of legislation passed in 1993. About 250 homes remain on Ward's Island today, housing approximately 600 residents. Many of these homes are unique from almost any others found in Toronto, located on tightly-packed, tiny plots of land and most featuring a humble, cottage-style look.",https://www.toronto.ca/data/parks/prd/facilities/complex/2039/index.html,Outdoor,"island,ward,cottage,homes,residents,toronto,housing,houses,parkland,tents",-79.35517779,43.63269888

Prominent nineteenth century Toronto families such as the Masseys and Gooderhams - who summered on the island - helped bring the church to fruition. Dennison utilized a semi-Gothic variation on an architectural style that was mostly used on cottages and summer hotels, giving the church a unique design. The church also features beautiful stained glass windows that were installed in the 1920s by noted artist Robert McCausland. It was moved to its present location in 1959, after being sawed in two and with great care taken to ensure that no damage was done to the windows. One unique tradition at the church is the 'Blessing of the Boats', where a number of vessels mostly from nearby yacht clubs are blessed by the rector, which has occurred annually in a lagoon behind the church since 1949.",,Outdoor,"church,boats,yacht,hotels,lagoon,masseys,cottages,blessing,glass,dennison",-79.36983231,43.62019355

Today Centreville features more than 30 rides and 14 food outlets, primarily geared towards families with young children. Some of the more notable rides include a roller coaster that is modelled after a mine train, a ferris wheel that resembles a wind mill, and a sky ride that offers great views of the park and surrounding island.

Aside from the many practical purposes, white pine was a figurative representation of peace to the nations of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy. To the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, white pine represents The Great Law of Peace. White pine's needles grow in clusters of five; the confederacy was originally comprised of five nations, and so, the Peacemaker's decision to choose white pine to symbolize unity was based out of that human to non-human relation. Indigenous knowledge often intertwines what is found naturally, into something that is found in teachable moments; in short Indigenous knowledge is very allegorical, and uses abstract ideas of nature to convey practical and sometimes spiritual ideas. Often times this proved to be quite an effective way of improving remembrance and discerning distinct ideas more effectively than by simply reading something and imagining what it could be. What could be found in nature, could be found in us as human beings, us being a part of nature and not separate from it.",,Outdoor,"pine,haudenosaunee,nature,tree,indigenous,wildlife,humber,species,confederacy,beings",-79.55303102,43.73540518

Over the years, many additions were made to the site including the Print Room, which offered dinner and dancing, spurring the Old Mill's live music tradition. Even after the sudden death of Robert Home Smith, the Old Mill continued to expand. During the 1990s, the ruins of the original grist mill were replaced by the Old Mill Hotel, with a spa and an English-style bar dedicated to Robert Home Smith.

It was built from a design prepared by Frank Barber, consulting engineer and Vaughan Township Engineer, who also built a truss bridge at Lambton Mills further up the river. While the bridge looks like a traditional stone arched bridge, Barber's use of concrete in the design of the bridge was a major departure from the traditional method of constructing.

Kilgour, widow of Toronto businessman Joseph Kilgour, donated her estate, Sunnybrook Farm, to the City of Toronto - the largest land gift to the City in its history at the time. It opened as Sunnybrook Park later that year, and in 1942 it was recommended for a 1,590-bed veterans hospital. The first veteran patients were admitted in 1946, and two years later, Sunnybrook Military Hospital officially opened. By the 1960s, the number of beds required for veterans had declined, but the need to provide veterans with continuing care facilities remained. The hospital and its lands were subsequently transferred to the University of Toronto, and in 1966 it became Sunnybrook Medical Centre, the first tertiary care teaching centre in Ontario. Today, Sunnybrook houses the largest veterans care centre in Canada, providing care to 500 war veterans.",,Outdoor,"sunnybrook,hospital,veterans,toronto,facilities,ontario,veteran,centre,beds,patients",-79.37487651,43.72360862

Leaside Junction was established in 1894, where the railroads meet. The town of Leaside was incorporated in 1913, shortly after the Canadian Northern Railway announced its intent to create a residential community.

Although the surrounding industrial buildings were demolished, the locomotive shop survived amid this commercial plaza, the largest surviving structure of the former Leaside Terminal.

Overseen by bridge designer Frank Barber, the construction of the bridge was completed in a mere 10 months, a record-breaking speed for its time. By the 1960s, the expansion of the city necessitated a widening of the bridge deck. More recently, the mosaic handrail - original to the 1927 bridge and designed by New York architect Claude Bragdon - was restored as part of a 2005 rehabilitation.

732,Cherry Beach and the Port Lands,1 Cherry Street,"The Port Lands make up an industrial and recreational zone in Toronto. The area was connected to the Toronto Islands archipelago until 1858, when a storm created a break in the land. The Port Lands were used as a waste disposal site from the mid to late nineteenth century, with companies such as Gooderham and Worts using it for farm and distillery waste. In 1912, to address health concerns, the Toronto Harbour Commission began developing the area for shipping, draining and filling in the marsh with the hope of making the area a major industrial hub; however, most industries had left the area by the 1970s. In the early 2000s, film studios were built in the area, and the Toronto Waterfront Revitalization Corporation (now Waterfront Toronto) planned to redevelop what had become the largest underdeveloped and underused space in North America. The Port Lands is home to a number of sailing clubs, and the Martin Goodman trail - named for a former editor-in-chief of the Toronto Star newspaper - connects the area to other waterfront destinations such as Cherry Beach. One of the calmer, warmer beaches in the east end, Cherry Beach is sheltered from the waves of Lake Ontario thanks to the Leslie Street Spit. It features picnic areas and an off-leash dog area, and was first made a park (then Clarke Beach Park) in the 1930s.

Although decommissioned in 1983, the building has recently been used as a temporary venue for the Toronto Luminato Festival. It stands in close proximity to the Leslie Street Spit, which is a five kilometre, man-made peninsula. Created in 1959 by filling the lake with dredged sand and construction waste, the Spit was intended as an extension of the Toronto Harbour and as a breakwater to control erosion. Natural wildlife had begun to take over the area after the 1970s, and it is now home to Tommy Thompson Park (named after the City's first Parks Commissioner). Much of the Spit is now classified as an Environmentally Sensitive Area (ESA), as well as an Important Bird Area.

652,Charles Coxwell Small Land,470 Woodbine Avenue,"In the early to mid-nineteenth century, a man named Charles Coxwell Small, a wealthy farmer and public official of Upper Canada, bought a 472-acre plot of land. The area stretched from present day Woodbine Avenue to Coxwell Avenue and Lake Ontario up to Danforth Avenue. He built a road along the west side of his land (now Coxwell Avenue). In 1853, Charles donated three acres of his estate to the local Anglican church, so they could move their meetings out of the local pub and into their own church building. A school house was the first building on site, and was moved here by a team of oxen. The school's bell is all that's left, now hung in the cemetery's crematorium. St. John the Baptist Norway Anglican Church was completed shortly after, but was replaced in 1893 thanks to its growing congregation. The cemetery was originally Anglican-only but has since become interfaith, with eighty thousand graves.

The area was connected to the Toronto Islands archipelago until 1858, when a storm created a break in the land. The Port Lands were used as a waste disposal site from the mid to late nineteenth century, with companies such as Gooderham and Worts using it for farm and distillery waste. In 1912, to address health concerns, the Toronto Harbour Commission began developing the area for shipping, draining and filling in the marsh with the hope of making the area a major industrial hub; however, most industries had left the area by the 1970s. In the early 2000s, film studios were built in the area, and the Toronto Waterfront Revitalization Corporation (now Waterfront Toronto) planned to redevelop what had become the largest underdeveloped and underused space in North America. The Port Lands is home to a number of sailing clubs, and the Martin Goodman trail - named for a former editor-in-chief of the Toronto Star newspaper - connects the area to other waterfront destinations such as Cherry Beach. One of the calmer, warmer beaches in the east end, Cherry Beach is sheltered from the waves of Lake Ontario thanks to the Leslie Street Spit.

Although decommissioned in 1983, the building has recently been used as a temporary venue for the Toronto Luminato Festival. It stands in close proximity to the Leslie Street Spit, which is a five kilometre, man-made peninsula. Created in 1959 by filling the lake with dredged sand and construction waste, the Spit was intended as an extension of the Toronto Harbour and as a breakwater to control erosion. Natural wildlife had begun to take over the area after the 1970s, and it is now home to Tommy Thompson Park (named after the City's first Parks Commissioner).

Water has life-giving properties akin to the life-giving properties of women who bear children. That aside, waterways proved to be essential for travel, for sustenance, for leisure and so on. Taddle Creek naturally flows through the Annex, across the University of Toronto campus, and further east into Lake Ontario where the creek channeled. That converging of waterways is now the intersection of Front and Parliament. Everything south of that intersection is artificial land that was manufactured for the sole purposes of expanding the railways in order to consolidate Canada's colonial hold over what is now Western Canada.

The Sugar Loaf was demolished to make room for the construction of the Bloor Street Viaduct.  Following Yellow Creek Northward leads one to the contemporary communities of Rosedale and Deer Park.

The savanna would have had scattered stands of trees (predominantly old growth red pine trees) punctuated by large areas of shrubs and grassland. Although it looked natural, this pine savanna was in fact managed by First Nations people through periodic controlled burns to encourage animals and plants that were significant sources of food and medicine.The existence of controlled burns is encoded in one of the Anishinaabemowin names for the Don River, which was recorded in an anglicized rendering as 'Wonscontonach'. This name roughly translates to a place swept by fire. ",,Outdoors,"creek,trails,trail,grassland,meadow,valley,savanna,ravine,rosedale,park",-79.374482,43.679363

1023,The Toronto Purchase,160 Bloor Street East,"In 1787, Crown representative Sir John Johnston met with representatives of the Mississaugas of the Credit at the Bay of Quinte in the hopes of gaining legal control of the land along Lake Ontario from Kingston to Niagara. At the meeting Johnston gifted the Mississaugas gunpowder, kettles, rum, lace hats, mirrors, and flannel. He later claimed that the gifts were payment for the requested land, a transaction that became known as the Toronto Purchase. Years later, the legitimacy of this claim came under scrutiny when the deed documenting the Toronto Purchase was discovered to be blank. The signatures of the Chiefs had been glued to the deed and the document lacked any description of the land that was supposedly sold to the Crown.  With the legality of the transaction called into question, the Crown negotiated a new agreement with the Mississaugas of the Credit in 1805. The Crown claimed that the Mississaugas willingly sold 250,830 acres of land to the Crown for 10 shillings. The land included in the purchase was bordered by Etobicoke Creek to the west, Ashbridge's Bay to the east, and 28 miles north of Lake Ontario to the north.  In 1986, the Mississaugas of the Credit challenged the fairness of the Toronto Purchase and submitted a Toronto Purchase specific claim with the Government of Canada. The Mississauga asserted that 10 shillings was an unfair purchase price for the land, that the Crown hadn't acted in good faith, and that the Crown had taken control of land beyond what was outlined in the agreement. In 2010, Government of Canada settled the case. The Mississaugas were awarded $145 million in compensation for the Toronto Purchase.

This private residence was formerly the home of Verna Patronella Johnston, an Ojibway author, mother, grandmother, and teacher. She lived in this home from 1966 to 1972. Johnston hosted many young Indigenous students in her home during this time to provide them a safe and welcoming home while they acquainted themselves to life away from home, in Toronto. The imposition of the Indian Act onto Indigenous communities by the federal government in the late 1800s disrupted Indigenous governance systems that were already in place that were well-suited to maintaining community cohesion and prosperity. This imposition of colonial control caused widespread economic depressions that Indigenous communities are still working to overcome today. This is but one of several factors that pushed many Indigenous community members across the country to seek economic opportunities in urban settings like Toronto. However, overt discrimination and systematic forms of oppression rendered many Indigenous people moving to cities vulnerable to poverty and risk. Indigenous people within cities were often disconnected from those they would call kin, and without these critical cultural, economic, and emotional support networks, it would be easier to lose one's identity and direction, or to slip into poverty. Verna Patronella's community-building work helped many Indigenous youth to be successful in the city. Verna's tireless efforts to build supports for Indigenous youth in Toronto and in her reserve community of Cape Croker earned her the title of 'Indian Woman of the Year', by the Native Women's Association in 1976.

This was at a time where girls could only get one at expensive private schools or in convent schools run by the Roman Catholic Church. It has operated as an independent school for girls ever since, and is considered to be the oldest continuously operating independent day and boarding school for girls in Canada. After moving several times, the school moved to this property in 1915. The school was built from Credit Valley limestone in the Collegiate Gothic style, and was designed by the same architects as College Park and the Royal York Hotel. Notable alumni include the first female computer scientist in Canada, Beatrice Helen Worsley, and Canadian women's rights activist Emily Murphy, who became the first woman magistrate in Canada and in the British Empire.",,Outdoors,"strachan,schools,bishop,founded,convent,school,church,toronto,anglican,collegiate",-79.40890004,43.68962284

Development in the Village of Forest Hill was enforced by strict by-laws that controlled the quality and appearance of new homes, including a minimum cost requirement for the construction of new homes. By the early 1930s, the village had become known for its high quality education and active community. This attracted many new residents to Forest Hill, and the construction of apartment buildings was encouraged in order to keep taxes low. The buildings provided a transition to the mostly single-family charm of Spadina Road further to the north. The first apartment buildings in the village were built in the 1920s around this intersection, but this building was not built until 1930. It was designed by architect Herbert George Duerr and is one of the few residential commissions he designed.

It was later marked on maps as Forest Hill Road North, before changing finally to Old Forest Hill Road in 1927, the same year the village was established. While the village boomed south of Eglinton Avenue, the north end of the village was slow to attract residential expansion. By 1931 only two houses had been built along the line until, finally, the bridge that carried the line over Bathurst Street was torn down in 1934. This sealed the fate of any train service and opened the door to further development in the area.

1168,The Humber River,Bridge over the Humber River (just outside of Weston Lions Park),"The Humber River Valley in Toronto's west end is an incredibly significant part of Toronto's pre-colonial Indigenous and early European history. The Humber River has its headwaters near Mono, north and west of Toronto, and snakes through Toronto before emptying into Lake Ontario at Humber Bay.  This river was part of a vast network of waterways including all the major rivers and lakes in the Great Lakes / St. Lawrence watershed, that facilitated a great deal of Indigenous movement and travel over a vast area spanning the interior of North America to the Atlantic Ocean and Northern Canada to the interior of the central United States. Indigenous footprints and paddle strokes followed the paths of these innumerable waterways for millennia before the arrival of Europeans to the continent.  The Humber River Valley was particularly significant as a major portage route used by First Nations people for thousands of years to travel between Georgian Bay or Lake Simcoe and Lake Ontario. The Mississaugas called the Humber River Kabechenong, which has been variously interpreted as 'resting place,' 'leave the canoes and go back,' or 'portage'. This portage was one of the fastest inland routes that allowed one to directly cross through what is now southern Ontario, making the Humber River Valley and Toronto itself a very important and desirable area for meeting, trade and exchanging information. There are dozens of Indigenous village and campsites known to have existed within the Humber River Valley collectively representing several thousand years of Indigenous occupation in the area and attesting to the long-lived importance of this route.

1198,The Alexandra Site,1900 McNicoll Avenue (inside the park),"In 2001, during the construction of a subdivision, a Wendat Village was discovered beneath the construction site. Estimated to have existed 600 years ago and roughly four acres in size, this village now known as the Alexandra Site was home to approximately one thousand Wendat people. The archeological dig that followed the discovery of this village found twenty thousand artifacts, including stone axes, bone beads, a woven mat, and pottery fragments. Some of these artifacts are housed at the University of Toronto.  Sixteen Longhouses once stood on this land, as well as several sweat lodges. The Wendat who lived here were farmers. Evidence of a three sisters garden of squash, beans, and corn were found at the site along with sunflower tubers and wild berries. The village's proximity to the now diverted Highland Creek would have provided access to fresh fish, drinking water, and a direct connection to Lake Ontario. This canoe route to Lake Ontario would have created opportunities for these villagers to participate in a vast network of Indigenous trade and commerce. In 2008, two plaques were installed to commemorate this village in L'Amoreaux Park which is adjacent to Mary Ward Secondary School in Scarborough.

The Scarborough Township purchased 225 acres of land and 145 buildings on Eglinton Avenue (the former GECo site) from the government. The farmlands on Eglinton Avenue from Victoria Park Avenue eastwards were soon transformed into the Golden Mile industrial complex. To attract businesses during Canada's post-war economic boom, the land was offered at inexpensive prices and low property taxes. Since then, the Golden Mile attracted a range of major companies, including Delco, Thermos, Frigidaire, and car manufacturers like General Motors and Volkswagen. In 1954, the Golden Mile Plaza opened at Victoria Park Avenue and Eglinton Avenue East, becoming the largest shopping centre in Canada. In 1959, the Golden Mile Plaza was even visited by Queen Elizabeth II. While the area was booming for a number of decades, many of these industries have moved out since the 1980s.

1263,Scarborough Bluffs,Scarborough Bluffs lookout in Bluffer's Park. West of Brimley Road South and the marina,"The Scarborough Bluffs have been a shoreline in Toronto for about 13,000 years. 13,000 years ago, ancient Lake Iroquois formed when the St. Lawrence River became blocked by an ice sheet near the present day Thousand Islands. The ice sheet created a dam, which trapped water during the retreat of a melting glacier. Lake Iroquois was also fed by Early Lake Erie and Glacial Lake Algonquin (which Lake Huron would emerge from). Lake levels at that time would have been approximately 30 metres (~100 feet) higher than Lake Ontario's current level. West of the Scarborough Bluffs, the original shoreline of Lake Iroquois heads inland, running between Kingston Road and Queen Street East, eventually following the north side of what is now called Davenport Road. When the ice dam melted, the lake lowered to the level it is today.  Rising 90 metres (300 feet) above contemporary Lake Ontario, the bluffs extend approximately 15 kilometers (9.3 miles) along the shoreline from the foot of Victoria Park Avenue to Highland Creek in the east. The Bluffs are constantly eroding due to human activities like building construction, and natural forces. The process of erosion created the Toronto Islands. They were formed when alluvial deposits (loose soil, silt, and clay) from the bluffs were reshaped by water and deposited away from the mainland.

It has an interesting history that reflects famous artists, powerful political figures and contributions made to the art community. The land was transformed into gardens and parkland by Rosa and Spencer Clark in the 1930s. The property and the architectural fragments ornamenting the gardens were sold to the Metro Toronto and Region Conservation Authority and the Province of Ontario in 1978 to be maintained as a public park. The land is also significant for its rare tract of Carolinian forest. Today there are efforts by the City of Toronto and community organizations to protect this forested area and the animals that it supports. The park is an important site for migratory and nesting birds, and mammals such as deer and fox. A notable architectural fragment found within the park is from the Temple Building. When the original building first opened in downtown Toronto, it was one of Toronto's first skyscrapers and was the highest building in the British Empire. It housed the office of the Independent Order of Foresters (IOF). At that time, a Mohawk doctor - and one of Canada's first physicians - Dr. Oronhyatekha (or Dr. O) was the Chief Ranger of the organization. The building was demolished in 1970, but you can still see this history reflected in the ornate IOF initials that are carved in the red sandstone blocks under the moose's head.",https://www.toronto.ca/data/parks/prd/facilities/complex/406/index.html,Outdoors,"forested,gardens,park,forest,foresters,toronto,guildwood,parkland,ontario,ranger",-79.19166629,43.74771606

Today, the Bickford House is a designated heritage property, and considered an excellent example of early twentieth century Period Revival style with Arts and Crafts detailing. In 1932, Rosa and Spencer Clark founded the Guild of All Arts after Rosa purchased 450 acres of land. The Guild of All Arts, mainly located in the Bickford House, was an artist colony that contained a shop, a tea room, and studios in fine art and craft, including painting, sculpture, hand loom weaving, tooled leather, ceramics, metal work, wood carving and batik. After the war, the Clarks expanded the colony to include a hotel, restaurant and formal gardens. The area became known as the Guild Inn or the Guild. During Toronto's building boom that began in the 1960s, many historic nineteenth and twentieth century downtown buildings were demolished. As an advocate for architectural preservation, Spencer Clark recovered many of these buildings' facades and architectural features and displayed them on the grounds of the Guild. The park and monuments were sold to the Metro Toronto and Region Conservation Authority in 1978. The hotel continued to be run by Spencer Clark until 1983. Today, the Bickford House has been restored and is home to the Guild Inn Estate, a restaurant, banquet hall and event space.",https://www.toronto.ca/explore-enjoy/festivals-events/cultural-hotspot/cultural-hotspot-tours/cultural-hotspot-tour-detail?id=sc34&title=The-Guild-Inn-Estate-(Bickford-House)&stop=5,Outdoors,"bickford,guild,downtown,park,gardens,building,harold,clarks,monuments,clark",-79.19204981,43.74779328

She also became an accomplished author in the 1940s, writing 5 books, one of which won a Governor General's Literary Award.

Mrs. Ormsby was involved in both the Temperance and Women's Suffrage movements, and held meetings at the home and in the extensive gardens on the property. Remnants of these gardens still remain within the grounds. The home was purchased by Dufferin Construction founder James Franceschini in 1925, who renamed the estate Myrtle Villa after his daughter. The property was seized at the start of the Second World War, as Franceschini's Italian heritage meant he was arrested and interned as a threat to the Canadian state.

It describes how the area was once home to many thousands of passenger pigeons. This large population was sustained by an equally large supply of seeds, acorns, and other nuts available within the vast Black Oak savanna just East of Omiimiikaa in the area of the Humber River, High Park, and Roncesvalles. Because the savannas were maintained and expanded by First Nations people through controlled burns, the historic presence of the passenger pigeons here can be linked directly to First Nations gardening practices and land stewardship. The passenger pigeon, in turn, formed a significant part of local First Nations diets and Omiimiikaa was thus an important hunting ground.  It is estimated that at the peak of their population there were five billion passenger pigeons across Turtle Island, roughly forty percent of the continent's entire bird population! Passenger pigeons were migratory, but would return to the same nesting places, like Omiimiikaa year after year. In these nesting areas, trees would sometimes have so many nests that their branches would break under the weight.  Sadly, passenger pigeons became extinct in a stunningly short period of time. With colonial expansion, so many birds were killed every season that their numbers became fewer every year. Unfortunately, at the time of settlement, they began to be hunted in excess to feed the growing population. The recognition of their endangered state came too late and the efforts to save the species were unsuccessful. The passenger pigeon was officially announced extinct in 1914.

Tecumseh witnessed many abuses and land thefts perpetuated by American soldiers and settlers against Shawnee during his youth and when he grew older, he increasingly fought in battles against the Americans in the years following the American Revolution. He fought for Indigenous sovereignty, land rights, and freedom from American tyranny, eventually rising to prominence as an influential chief among his people. In this role he worked to unite different First Nations into a pan-Indigenous alliance against the Americans, as Pontiac, Brant, and other Indigenous leaders had done before him. He had become an inspired orator with a clear message: the First Nations overcome longstanding rivalries and work together to save their land and cultures from the common American threat.  During the War of 1812, he worked with the British against the Americans. Using guerilla-style hit-and-run and ambush tactics Tecumseh won some important victories during the war. In one famous battle in August 1812 he, alongside Sir Isaac Brock, succeeded in forcing an unopposed surrender of Fort Detroit.  Shortly after receiving an ominous premonition, Tecumseh was killed in action during the Battle of Moraviantown, on October 5, 1813. Tecumseh refused to accept tyranny, risking everything to inspire and unite many different First Nations in a common fight for sovereignty and freedom.

It was intended to be an industrial facility, as it was widely believed at the time that prisoners should be put to work while incarcerated, and included a woolen mill, blacksmiths, furniture shop, kitchen, and bakery. The prison quickly became notorious for its dreadful conditions, as inmates were regularly subjected to brutal beatings, whippings, and prolonged periods of solitary confinement.

1679,The Shoreline: A Place of Meetings / Fort York,250 Fort York Boulevard,"Fort York was originally located along the shoreline of Lake Ontario, strategically located at the Western entrance to the Toronto Harbour, strengthening the defensibility of York further to the East.  On April 27, 1813 the fort was attacked by a force of 2,700 American soldiers on fourteen ships. In addition to the British soldiers stationed at the fort, a force of Anishinaabe warriors helped in the defensive effort. The Anishinaabe warriors used guerilla-style tactics to snipe at the Americans while concealing their numbers and position within the trees located along the shoreline. The Americans eventually overwhelmed the fort's defenses, the fort was destroyed, and the settlement of York was looted for several days.  The fort's defenses were rebuilt, but as the defensive importance of the fort declined and with the increasing prominence of rail transportation in the 1850s, Toronto's shoreline around Fort York began to be filled in to make way for railways. All the land currently to the south of Fort York is thus land fill added since the nineteenth century. A new installation at the Visitor Center attempts to recall the original landscape that bordered the city using weathered steel panels and landscaping that align with the contours of the original shoreline.  The recreated shoreline allows visitors to contemplate the vastness of Lake Ontario, and the drastic changes that the land has undergone.

1684,"Monument and Memory: The Second Invasion of York, 1813 / Coronation Park",711 Lake Shore Boulevard West,"Coronation Park was established in 1937. The trees planted there commemorate veterans of the First World War and other battles, including the 1885 Metis resistance and the Fenian raids of 1866. First Nations and Metis people have a long history of fighting alongside Britain and later Canada in many wars. For example, during the War of 1812, 8410 Anishinaabeg warriors fought alongside the British against the Americans.  Government records estimate that over 4000 Indigenous people enlisted in the First World War, however the true number is likely much higher as Metis and First Nations people without 'Indian Status' were not recognized as Indigenous in the records. Francis Pegahmagabow was Ojibwe, a member of Wasauksing First Nation, a decorated First World War veteran, and part of the 1st Canadian Division which is commemorated in the park. He is recognized as a war hero and was the deadliest sniper of the First World War, having killed 378 enemy soldiers. Like many status Indian veterans who returned home after fighting for Canada, he was not allowed to vote in Canadian elections and was still considered to be a ward of the state by the federal government.  On the southern edge of the park is the Victory-Peace Monument. Over 3000 Indigenous people are recognized to have fought in the Second World War, however, just like in the First World War the real number is likely much higher. One of the most decorated Indigenous soldiers in Canadian history was Tommy Prince. He was Ojibwe, a member of Brokenhead Ojibway First Nation, and a residential school survivor. He earned 11 medals during his military career. He was a member of an elite unit referred to as 'the Devil's Brigade' by the Germans. It was a specialized group made up of both American and Canadian soldiers. His bravery and skill on the field earned him both a Military Medal (Canadian) and a Silver Star (American).

Long distance running was not so much a sport as it was a way of life for many Indigenous People. Traveling far distances, certain individuals from each community were sometimes chosen to deliver messages and those most competent, and those with the most endurance were usually chosen to do this.

Thousands of people came to visit the temporary memorial, generating widespread support for the creation of a more permanent installation. The structure seen today was installed in 1991, designed by architect Patrick Fahn.

In response, Dr. Emily Stowe and several other like-minded people, founded Woman's Medical College at 289 Sumach Street in 1883. In 1898 a clinic called The Dispensary was opened at the College.  The clinic enabled female patients to receive unique services from women doctors. The college operated until 1905 when the University of Toronto finally began admitting female students to the medical school. From there, a group of Toronto women began to establish what was to become the Women's College Hospital, which opened in 1913 at 18 Seaton Street.

The primary tenant and namesake of the mall was Eaton's department store, which for a time was the largest department store retailer in Canada.

This property is also located in what used to be known as The Ward. In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the area was a dense slum, home to the poor and impoverished and was officially known as St. John's Ward, and was home to Toronto's first Chinatown. Filming done at Toronto City Hall includes scenes from 'The Handmaids Tale', 'The Expanse' and 'Resident Evil'. Across the way (at corner of Bay Street) is Old City Hall which officially opened in 1899 after 10 years of construction. Installed in the building is a stained glass representation of the original Toronto Coat of Arms. The City of Toronto has had at least two coats of arms. The first was created following the incorporation of the city in 1834, when the city was also renamed back to 'Toronto' from 'York'. The current Toronto coat of arms originated in 1998 when, following the amalgamation of the Greater Toronto Area, the coat of arms was updated with new iconography.  The original coat of arms consisted of a shield framed by two figures on either side, with a beaver and crown placed on top and a banner below. One of the figures, a cloaked and helmeted woman holding a trident and shield, represents Britannia, the personification of Britain. The other, a generic depiction of an eighteenth century First Nations man with a bow and axe, is presumably meant to represent the First Nations of the area of Toronto. The iconography of the shield includes a red maple leaf, gold lions, a white rose, a gear, and a steamship, representing Canada, Britain, York, and industry, respectively. On the banner are written the words, 'Industry, Intelligence, Integrity'. The references to industry and the beaver speak to Toronto's character at the time as a 'resource town' with origins in the early fur trade.  In January 1999, the current coat of arms became official. 'Diversity Our Strength' became the new city motto. A yellow shield in the centre of the design is marked by two blue lines that represent the two towers of City Hall.  The bear represents strength and protection while the beaver is included as a symbol of industry. The inclusion of the eagle acknowledges that Toronto is built on the traditional territory of the Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation, whose logo also incorporates an eagle.

1841,Former War Amps Building,140 Merton Street,"This heritage-designed building was the headquarters of War Amps from 1960 until 1994. War Amps was originally founded in 1918 by veteran and amputee Lieutenant Colonel Sidney Lambert, intended to help those who suffered amputations in war with practical assistance and counselling. They created their now famous key tag program in 1946 as a way to assist veterans achieve independence through employment while helping to return over 1.5 million lost keys. They have since expanded their programs to assist all those who have lost limbs. The building was designed by architect Charles Dolphin, who is perhaps best known for designing the Postal Delivery Building that is now part of Scotiabank Arena. In 2022, the City of Toronto announced a new project with the Missanabie First Nation that will see the building converted to 184 rental apartments for Indigenous seniors, the first ever Indigenous-led housing development for seniors under the City's 'Housing Now' initiative.",,Indoors,"building,missanabie,veterans,apartments,housing,toronto,headquarters,scotiabank,postal,heritage",-79.39175366,43.69721208
1842,170 Merton Street,170 Merton Street,"This building is distinctly representative of the post-war style called Late Modernism, a style characterized by the octagonal turret and the use of concrete brick and mortar.  It was designed by architect Leslie Rebanks, a Fellow of the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada and a member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts. This building was once the former headquarters for the Visiting Homemakers Association (VHA), which was a Toronto-based social-welfare agency, founded in 1925. The agency assisted underprivileged families, the sick, the elderly and people living with intellectual disabilities and homelessness while also researching the co-relations between poverty, health and low wages.",,Outdoors,"architect,building,homemakers,founded,headquarters,modernism,representative,vha,institute,architectural",-79.39081219,43.69737388
1843,Dominion Coal and Wood Plaque,379 Mt. Pleasant Road,"Note: Private property. Please observe this point of interest from the sidewalk only. Where these condo buildings now stand is the same place where the nine silos of Dominion Coal and Wood once stood. Dominion Coal and Wood was founded in 1912 and, although it was originally located on Danforth Avenue, the facility moved to this site in 1929. Its proximity to the Belt Line Railway facilitated distribution of wood and coal across Canada, and then sold as heating fuel to local businesses and homeowners. The site closed in 2009 and the property was rezoned for residential use. A Heritage Toronto plaque near the stairs leading from the west side of Mt. Pleasant Road down to the Kay Gardner Beltline Trail notes the history of the site. Down the steps and on the left, there's a mural painted by the students of Greenwood School in 2014. The three elements in the mural represent the neighbourhood, the trains that used to run along the Belt Line Railway, and the Dominion Coal and Wood silos.",,Outdoors,"greenwood,dominion,condo,toronto,buildings,mural,residential,beltline,avenue,represent",-79.38647248,43.69777359
