1,"Toronto Island Ferries & Ward's Island Ferry Docks","Ward's Island Ferry Docks","Ferries have been traversing the short route across Toronto Harbour from the mainland to Toronto Island Park for almost 180 years, with the first vessel - a boat powered by two horses walking on a treadmill - entering commercial service in 1833. At this time, Toronto Island was actually a peninsula connected to the mainland near the mouth of the Don River. A violent storm in April 1858 permanently severed the island from the mainland, creating the now 300-metre wide Eastern Gap. Most of the ferries still operating to the island today are diesel boats constructed between 1935 and 1960. One vessel, the Trillium, is over 100 years old, and is the only sidewheel paddle steamer still sailing in North America! While ferry services operate to 2 other different points on the island for much of the year (Centre Island and Hanlan's Point), Ward's Island is the only dock that offers year-round service.
